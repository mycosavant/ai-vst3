# OBSIDIAN-Neural

🎵 **Real-time AI music generation VST3 plugin for live performance**

---

> _"I've cycled through almost every AI music tool on the market, but Obsidian is the first one that actually feels like a **real production tool** rather than a novelty. While other AI apps try to replace the songwriter, Obsidian treats AI like a powerful, playable instrument. The 8-track MIDI-triggering is a total game-changer—having immediate access to eight distinct loops that I can mix and manipulate individually makes it feel like a **smart sampler** rather than a 'black box.' Because it lives directly in my DAW, there is **zero latency** and zero break in my workflow; I'm not downloading files or waiting for a browser to render. It stays perfectly locked to my project's tempo and vibe, serving as the ultimate **'intelligent jam partner VST'** whenever I need to break through a creative block, or start a new track from scratch."_

## Draw-to-Audio Live Demo

**Watch the draw-to-audio feature in action** - Live improvisation session showing real-time sketch-to-sound generation:

[![Draw-to-Audio Demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/zhJ865KoPCU/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/zhJ865KoPCU)

_Raw improvisation showcasing the experimental draw-to-audio workflow: sketch patterns → AI interprets visuals → generates matching loops on the fly._

## What Obsidian Neural does

Type words → Get musical loops instantly. No stopping your creative flow.

- **8-track sampler** with MIDI triggering (C3-B3)
- **4 pages per track** (A/B/C/D) - Switch variations instantly
- **8 sequences per page** - 256 total patterns for complex live sets
- **16-step sequencer** with multi-measure support
- **Quantized page changes** - Seamless transitions locked to measure boundaries
- **Draw-to-sound** - Sketch your ideas visually and let AI interpret them musically
- **Perfect DAW sync** - Auto time-stretch to project tempo
- **Real-time generation** - No pre-recorded samples

**Text example:** Type "dark techno kick" → AI generates techno loop → Program sequence → Switch between 8 pattern variations

**Performance example:**

- Page A: Main groove (8 sequences)
- Page B: Breakdown variation (8 sequences)
- Page C: Build-up (8 sequences)
- Page D: Drop (8 sequences)
- Switch pages at measure boundaries while performing live

---

## What Obsidian Neural does NOT

**OBSIDIAN Neural is NOT a song generator** like Suno or Udio. It's a performance tool for musicians:

- **No full songs in one click** - You build your track loop by loop
- **No lyrics or vocals** - Focus on instrumental loops and sound design
- **No auto-arrangement** - You're the composer, AI is your loop generator

**Think of it as:** A creative sampler that generates sounds on-demand, not a "press play and get a song" tool.

---

## Features

### Multi-Layer Performance System

**256 independent patterns at your fingertips** - Each of the 8 tracks features a powerful multi-page, multi-sequence architecture:

- **4 pages per track** (A/B/C/D) - Switch variations instantly with page buttons
- **8 sequences per page** - Independent MIDI patterns per page (32 sequences per track total)
- **Live page switching** - Quantized to measure boundaries for seamless transitions
- **Per-page sequence memory** - Each page remembers its active sequence
- **Quantized beat repeat** - Stutter/retrigger effects locked to tempo (1/4 to 1/128 subdivisions)
- **Random retrigger intervals** - Enable automatic random interval selection for evolving patterns
- **Seamless loop points** - Adjustable start/end points per page with auto-crossfade

**Example workflow:**

- Track 1, Page A, Sequence 1: Simple 4-on-floor kick
- Track 1, Page A, Sequence 2: Broken beat variation
- Track 1, Page B, Sequence 1: Minimal pattern
- Enable beat repeat on Track 1 → Instant stuttered fills
- Switch pages and sequences on the fly during performance

### Beat Repeat & Performance FX

**Quantized stutter effects** that stay locked to your DAW tempo:

- **10 interval presets**: 4 bars, 2 bars, 1 bar, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, 1/64, 1/128
- **Half-beat quantization** - Beat repeat triggers snap to nearest half-beat
- **Random duration mode** - Automatically randomizes interval length (1-10) on each trigger
- **MIDI learnable** - Map beat repeat toggle and interval knob to any controller
- **Visual feedback** - Interval knob displays current subdivision

**How it works:**

1. Load a sample on any track
2. Enable beat repeat
3. Adjust interval knob (or enable random mode)
4. Effect triggers quantized to half-beats
5. Returns to original playback seamlessly

**Performance tricks:**

- Use on drum loops for instant fill variations
- Combine with page switching for complex breakdowns
- Enable random duration for evolving glitch textures
- MIDI map to foot controller for hands-free triggering

### Text-to-Audio Generation

Type natural language descriptions and get instant musical loops:

- "dark techno kick"
- "ambient pad with reverb"
- "808 bass with distortion"

### Draw-to-Audio Generation

**Express your musical ideas visually** _(original concept by A.D.)_ - Each track includes a drawing canvas where you can sketch patterns, shapes, or abstract concepts. The AI analyzes your drawing using a Vision Language Model (VLM) and translates visual elements into musical descriptions:

1. Click the **Draw** button on any track
2. Use pencil, brush, spray, or eraser tools
3. Choose colors and brush sizes
4. Click **Generate** to send your drawing

**How it works:**

- Your drawing is encoded as Base64 image data
- A Vision Language Model interprets the visual elements using musical vocabulary
- The generated textual description is sent to the audio generation model
- Result: A unique sound that matches your visual concept

**Example workflow:**

- Draw sharp, angular lines → AI interprets as "aggressive staccato synth"
- Sketch flowing curves → AI interprets as "smooth flowing pad"
- Use red/orange colors → AI might associate with "warm analog tones"
- Create chaotic patterns → AI interprets as "glitchy percussion"

**Canvas features:**

- 512x512 drawing area
- 4 brush types (Pencil, Brush, Spray, Eraser)
- 10 color presets
- Adjustable brush size (1-50)
- State preservation per track/page

This feature bridges the gap between visual creativity and sonic experimentation, allowing producers to explore sound design through intuitive visual metaphors.

**Note:** This draw-to-audio feature is currently experimental and under active development.
