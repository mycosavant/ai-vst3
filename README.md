## What it does

Type words → Get musical loops instantly. No stopping your creative flow.

- **8-track sampler** with MIDI triggering (C3-B3)
- **4 pages per track** (A/B/C/D) - Switch variations instantly by clicking page buttons
- **Draw-to-sound** - Sketch your ideas visually and let AI interpret them musically
- **Perfect DAW sync** - Auto time-stretch to project tempo
- **Real-time generation** - No pre-recorded samples

**Text example:** Type "dark techno kick" → AI generates techno loop → Trigger with MIDI while jamming

**Drawing example:** Draw a chaotic pattern → AI interprets visual elements as musical characteristics → Generates matching loop

## Features

### Text-to-Audio Generation

Type natural language descriptions and get instant musical loops:

- "dark techno kick"
- "ambient pad with reverb"
- "808 bass with distortion"

### Draw-to-Audio Generation

**Express your musical ideas visually** _(original concept by A.D.)_ - Each track includes a drawing canvas where you can sketch patterns, shapes, or abstract concepts. The AI analyzes your drawing using a Vision Language Model (VLM) and translates visual elements into musical descriptions:

1. Click the **Draw** button on any track
2. Use pencil, brush, spray, or eraser tools
3. Choose colors and brush sizes
4. Click **Generate** to send your drawing

**How it works:**

- Your drawing is encoded as Base64 image data
- A Vision Language Model interprets the visual elements using musical vocabulary
- The generated textual description is sent to the audio generation model
- Result: A unique sound that matches your visual concept

**Example workflow:**

- Draw sharp, angular lines → AI interprets as "aggressive staccato synth"
- Sketch flowing curves → AI interprets as "smooth flowing pad"
- Use red/orange colors → AI might associate with "warm analog tones"
- Create chaotic patterns → AI interprets as "glitchy percussion"

**Canvas features:**

- 512x512 drawing area
- 4 brush types (Pencil, Brush, Spray, Eraser)
- 10 color presets
- Adjustable brush size (1-50)
- State preservation per track/page

This feature bridges the gap between visual creativity and sonic experimentation, allowing producers to explore sound design through intuitive visual metaphors.

**Note:** This draw-to-audio feature is currently experimental and under active development.
